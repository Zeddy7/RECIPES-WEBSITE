# RECIPES-WEBSITE

Project Summary

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course and focuses on building a simple recipe website. The goal is to practice creating multiple web pages, linking them together, and displaying information in a clean, structured format. Each page contains a recipe with ingredients, steps, and images. This project helped me get comfortable with writing semantic HTML and organizing content for the web.

Tools & Technologies Used

HTML5 → for building the structure of the web pages
Git & GitHub → for version control and publishing the project online.
VS Code → as the main text editor for writing and organizing code.
Linux (Ubuntu) → as my working environment.
What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to structure HTML documents properly using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. I also practiced using relative links to connect multiple pages, which is an essential skill for building websites. Additionally, I gained experience in using Git for tracking changes and GitHub for hosting, which are important tools for any developer
