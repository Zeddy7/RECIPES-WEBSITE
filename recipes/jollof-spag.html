    <h2 class="heading">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p class="para">The dish is typically made with spaghetti, tomatoes, chillis, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat/chicken/fish/egg in a single pot.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>1 lb usually 1 box thin spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 3/4 cups chicken stock I used a home made stock</li>
                <li>5 large about 2 lbs plum/ roma tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 large onion</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
                <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tsp bouillon powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
                <li>A small handful of basil optional</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="heading">INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes, onions, and peppers until smooth.</li>
            <li>Boil down the tomato sauce on in a pot on medium- high heat until the sauce is about half the amount, and has thickened significantly to look like a paste. 
                This takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how high the heat is.
            </li>
            <li>Be sure to stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from burning.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is reduced, pour in the stock, oil, thyme, curry powder and bouillon. At this stage, taste the sauce and adjust for salt.</li>
            <li>Add in the spaghetti, pushing it down or breaking it to fit into the pot.</li>
            <li>Cover and allow to cook for 5 minutes on low-medium heat.></li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, the pasta should be soft enough to stir. Stir, turn down the heat to low, and allow to cook for another 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 8 minutes, stir, and the pasta should be cooked. If it is not, add in a splash (about 1/4 cup) of water and continue to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you choose to add basil, add it in at this stage, and then serve.</li>
        </ol>
